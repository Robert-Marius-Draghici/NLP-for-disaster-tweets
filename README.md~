# NLP-for-disaster-tweets

This repository contains the solution that I have implemented for the Kaggle competition "Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets".

To run the notebooks on your local environment, run the script run.sh which will set up a docker environment and run the jupyter lab command. The notebooks will be accessible in the browser at localhost:8888 with the current settings. Note that the docker environment does not make use of the GPU if available. For GPU access, you can run these notebooks in Google Colaboratory with a few adjustments (there is some commented code which can help with the setup in each notebook).

To learn more about the implementation there are two power point presentations and a PDF report that cover the details.
